# Pokémon Battle Simulator

Welcome to the Pokémon Battle Simulator! This project is a fun implementation of a Pokémon battle simulation using the public [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/). The simulation aims to include as many battle mechanics as possible, including Pokémon moves, animations, and side effects like paralysis, sleep, burn, freeze, and confusion.

## Features

- Simulates Pokémon battles with various moves and abilities.
- Pokémon moves are randomly generated through the move pool of each Pokémon.
- Implements generic move animations for physical, special, and status moves.
- Includes move side effects such as paralysis, sleep, burn, freeze, and confusion.
- Enemy Pokémon uses a basic Minimax algorithm logic for move selection.
- Aims to be as accurate as possible using the data from PokeApi.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **RTK Query**: For data fetching and state management.
- **TypeScript**: For type checking and enhancing code quality.
- **CSS**: For styling the app.
